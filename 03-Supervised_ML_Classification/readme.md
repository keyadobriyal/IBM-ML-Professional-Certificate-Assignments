This is third module introduces to one of the main types of modeling families of supervised Machine Learning: Classification. 

The course focused on how to train predictive models to classify categorical outcomes and how to use error metrics to compare across different models. 

The hands-on section of this course focused on using best practices for classification, including train and test splits, and handling data sets with unbalanced classes.

**Objectives:**
- Differentiate uses and applications of classification and classification ensembles
- Describe and use logistic regression models
- Describe and use decision tree and tree-ensemble models
- Describe and use other ensemble methods for classification
- Use a variety of error metrics to compare and select the classification model that best suits your data
- Use oversampling and undersampling as techniques to handle unbalanced classes in a data set

**Assignment**
- The assignment was focused on hands-on experience in communicating insightful and impactful findings to stakeholders. 
- Use the tools and techniques you learned throughout this course to train a few classification models on a data set 
- Select the regression that best suits your needs, and communicate insights you found from your modeling exercise.
- Submit a report highlighting analytical skills and thought process. 

I am working on application of machine learning on geoscience and have created facies classification for the assignment.
