This is third module introduces to one of the main types of modeling families of supervised Machine Learning: Classification. 

The course focused on how to train predictive models to classify categorical outcomes and how to use error metrics to compare across different models. 

The hands-on section of this course focused on using best practices for classification, including train and test splits, and handling data sets with unbalanced classes.

**Objectives:**
- Differentiate uses and applications of classification and classification ensembles
- Describe and use logistic regression models
- Describe and use decision tree and tree-ensemble models
- Describe and use other ensemble methods for classification
- Use a variety of error metrics to compare and select the classification model that best suits your data
- Use oversampling and undersampling as techniques to handle unbalanced classes in a data set

The assignment was focused on hands-on experience in communicating insightful and impactful findings to stakeholders. 

In this project you will use the tools and techniques you learned throughout this course to train a few classification models on a data set that you feel passionate about, select the regression that best suits your needs, and communicate insights you found from your modeling exercise.

After going through some guided steps, you will have insights that either explain or predict your outcome variable. As a main deliverable, you will submit a report that helps you focus on highlighting your analytical skills and thought process. 

I am working on application of machine learning on geoscience and have created facies classification for the assignment.
