This course introduces you to one of the main types of modelling families of supervised Machine Learning: Regression. You will learn how to train regression models to predict continuous outcomes and how to use error metrics to compare across different models. This course also walks you through best practices, including train and test splits, and regularization techniques.

By the end of this course you should be able to:
- Differentiate uses and applications of classification and regression in the context of supervised machine learning 
- Describe and use linear regression models
- Use a variety of error metrics to compare and select a linear regression model that best suits your data
- Articulate why regularization may help prevent overfitting
- Use regularization regressions: Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic net
 
The assignment to complete module required to apply regression techniques to analyze a dataset of your choice. 

The task was to preprocess the data, build and compare models, extract insights, and suggest next steps.

**Learning Objectives**
- Describe the dataset and its key features.
- Clearly state the goal of the analysis.
- Apply and compare linear regression models.
- Present key findings from the analysis.
- Identify model flaws and suggest improvements.
- Evaluate the model using an AI tool

I used famous IRIS dataset for completing the assignment.
