This first course in the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate introduces you to Machine Learning and the content of the professional certificate. In this course you will realize the importance of good, quality data. You will learn common techniques to retrieve your data, clean it, apply feature engineering, and have it ready for preliminary analysis and hypothesis testing.

**The module incorporates:**
- Retrieve data from multiple data sources: SQL, NoSQL databases, APIs, Cloud 
- Describe and use common feature selection and feature engineering techniques
- Handle categorical and ordinal features, as well as missing values
- Use a variety of techniques for detecting and dealing with outliers
- Articulate why feature scaling is important and use a variety of scaling techniques

The assignment for completing all modules requires to apply the skills learned throughout the course to analyze a dataset of your choice, either from the course materials or an external source. 

You will perform data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data visualization, and hypothesis testing to derive meaningful insights. Upon completion, your work will be evaluated automatically by an AI grading tool.

**Learning Objectives**
- Preprocess and clean data for analysis.
- Engineer and transform features to enhance insights.
- Utilize visualizations to explore data patterns and trends.
- Conduct hypothesis testing to validate assumptions.
- Demonstrate proficiency in data analysis through an AI-graded final assignment.

I utilized mpg dataset that comes with seaborn library and carried out Exploratory Data Analysis.
